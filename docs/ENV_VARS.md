## Environmental Variables

The `create-react-app` script/package can't deal with simple things like making the changing of environmental variables and deployment locations easy so:
a) Modify .env.local for local env adjustments
b) edit the package the JSON when building for staging or production
c) Use a Parcel bootstrap for first
